        <name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mottainai: Wutai Mountain</name>

        <description>Mottainai: Wutai Mountain, an expansion for Mottainai that you need only one copy of regardless of
            player count, is a deck of &amp;quot;Om&amp;quot; works. Each such work can gather its own set of helpers,
            materials, and sales tucked underneath it, and it has a special ability that grants benefits based on those
            cards. Expect even more exciting and powerful combinations!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
