# Swirl work

Better than JIRA, better than Trello, we've got a list!

Throw anything down in here big or small.

- In inbox view, I'd like a quick way to dismiss recommendations (Example: Dan said I should watch breaking bad. I know I'm not going to.). May need a "quick response" txt field too
- Links to buy music/books
- Swirl Creation: Should be less "open text field".  Each swirl should have a "media" (normally an image), Some default text (blurb/ track listing) and a 
"note from me", e.g. why I want you to check this awesome thing out.
- Make website not look pants.
- Swirls should be a group convo. on http://www.youshouldwatchreadlisten.com/swirls/37 Dan said "Did I ever mention you guys should read this?". Which guys? I DON'T KNOW!
- When a user registers as result of suggestion, immediately add suggester and suggestee to each other's network.
- Make logins not case sensitive
- Make test-refersh not cache html
